<h1>Testing Matlab documentation publishing</h1>

<p>This is a general landing page that contains links to the Matlab-published files. In the future, test autogenerating this main page as well (from index.m?). The way this currently works is the hand-generated index.html (this page) has hand-generated links to pages published from Matlab. It would be nicer to publish in the form of Matlab toolboxes which match Mathworks' online documentation. Looking into that now. It looks like a more Matlab-internal API-type thing. Going that route may involve (re)packaging and installing development code as Matlab toolboxes constantly just to get the documentation.</p>

<p>Alternatively, there's other Matlab-specific tools like m2html that may give more flexibility. Going beyond Matlab, restructured text/markdown in Sphinx may also be useful.</p>

<p>The docs below are generated by calling the pub function in the base dir of the master branch.</p>
